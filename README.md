# Q1: Identify Functional and Non-functional requirements of Library Information System(LIS)
# Functional requirements:
• Members should able to borrow a book or return it while sitting at his desk/chamber.

• Member should be able to extend the deadline of the book.

• Librarian staff should be able to do day-to-day book transactions.

• One Librarian should have administrative privileges and complete control over the system.

• Librarian should be able to enter a new record and also able to remove existing book record.

• Any non-member should able to search and browse books freely online.

• Issuing and returning of books is only restricted to members of institute.

• Verification emails in case of registration 

• System must send a confirmation email whenever a person issues a book 

• System must have a feature to organize the books into category while issuing 

• Editing, adding and deleting the book records by the librarian  

• User can search for a book 

• Librarian can send a message

# Non-Functional requirements:
• User-friendly interface for ease of use.

• The system should only run within Institute LAN for security purpose.

• Any confidential information(like passwords) should not be stored as plain text.

• System should be scalable to handle growth of the institute.

• System should be compatible with every browser and OS.

• The web application should be developed using latest HTML 5 technology.

# Q2: Identify scopes,features and Non-Functional aspects of disabling hearing loss problem
# Scope:
• There are 466 million people in this earth and from them around Approximately 5% people are suffing from disabling hearing loss.

• This Application will help those people by alerting them using vibration in different kind of critical situation.

• This Application will use Artifical intelligence to detect different kind of sound and alert user.

• This Application will give freedom to this kind of people such that they can move around.

• Latency of system should be less such that it can become real time.

# Features:
• Application should use Artificial Intelligence to detect sound.

• User can choose different kind of vibration for each kind of critical situation.

• System should keep track of live location and there should be contact details of family member of user , such that in extreme critical situation it shares live location to given contacts.

• System should take response from user such that, system can stop vibration.

• System should run in background also.

• It should provide path where traffic is less, such user will be more relax to walk from there.

• System should consume less battery.

# Non-Functional Requirments:
• Algorithm on which system is running should be more accurate.

• Error should be as minimum as possible.

• Contact number of user's family and live location of user should not be leaked anyway and no one can trace user.

• System should be scalable, such that due to increasing userbase there should not be any kind of problem in updation of system.
